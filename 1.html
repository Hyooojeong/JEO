  <h2>PART1</h2>
  Last week my baby left me
  For somebody ugly
  And I kinda felt some type of way
  But I was buggin
  Cause I got a check in the mail that was kinda thick
  And I ain’t had to spend a single dollar on that stupid
  Can be a little cloudy
  <strong>But after the rain</strong>
  <strong>It always starts shinning</strong>
  And that’s exactly how it is for this teddy bear
  So I took my check to the bank and I danced all the way there
